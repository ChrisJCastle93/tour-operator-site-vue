Step into vibrant squares, such as Piazza Santa Maria, and indulge in popular street food, from cheesy supplì to delicious cannoli.\n\nIf you've chosen the tour of the Jewish Quarter, head to the lively Campo De' Fiori square where one of the oldest open-air markets takes place every morning.\n\nThen, follow your guide to Rome's Jewish Quarter and see highlights, including the Portico of Octavia and the Turtle Fountain.\n\nThroughout both tours, enjoy five tastings with some wine and beer. Finally, make your way to an ice cream shop for a much-deserved treat. Both tours finish on a sweet note with the perfect Italian gelato."
