Explore Antoni Gaudi's unfinished masterpiece of the Sagrada Familia – the UNESCO-listed site that dominates the Barcelona skyline.\n\nWith the handy audio guide, walk through the history of this beautiful basilica that has been under construction since 1882. Find out why Gaudi took over the project from the original architect, Francisco de Paula del Villar.\n\nAdmire the combination of neo-Gothic and Art Nouveau design features and see what made Gaudi's work stand out. From impressive facades, mesmerizing playful shapes, and stunning colorful mosaic details, the Sagrada Familia's design makes it a one-of-a-kind place of worship.\n\nGaudi began working on the Sagrada Familia exclusively from 1914 until he died in 1926. A remarkable feat of design, it remains a work in progress today – constructed using materials from Gaudi's workshops and continuing the ideas found in plans and photographs.\n\nWhile unfinished, the basilica remains a must-see attraction and an important site that preserves the great architect's forward-thinking, discipline-breaking, symbolic visions.",
