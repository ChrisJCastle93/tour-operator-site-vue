LATER REFACTORING: 

- cart not adding to local storage atm?
- fix add to cart
- Refactor localstorage service so the logic happens in Vuex and the service only adds to local storage. Vuex action will need to get from local storage, set up the cart, and add to local storage. localStorage should be source of truth.
