- Create Search Results Page and functionality
- Create ability to review products and then display them
- Create checkout functionality w/ Stripe
- Create ability to view previous orders based on name and order reference

THEN: 
- Make Responsive
- Convert to TypeScript


LATER: 

- Refactor localstorage service so the logic happens in Vuex and the service only adds to local storage. Vuex action will need to get from local storage, set up the cart, and add to local storage. localStorage should be source of truth.
