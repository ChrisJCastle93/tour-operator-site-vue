[✅] Convert BE to TypeScript

[ ] Convert FE to TypeScript

[ ] Add some tests

[ ] Switch to Tailwind

[ ] Make Responsive

[ ] Convert to Composition API

[✅] Refactor store and router into modules

[ ] Make the store Type safe

NEXT: 

- Add Types to Views
- Add Types to Services

LATER REFACTORING: 

- cart not adding to local storage atm?
- fix add to cart
- Refactor localstorage service so the logic happens in Vuex and the service only adds to local storage. Vuex action will need to get from local storage, set up the cart, and add to local storage. localStorage should be source of truth.
